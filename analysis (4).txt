It's impossible to give exact calorie counts without knowing the precise weights and preparation methods of each food item in the image.  However, I can provide estimates based on typical serving sizes and common preparation methods.  These are approximations, and the actual calorie count may vary.

**Calorie Estimates (Approximate):**

1. **Fried Egg:** One large egg (fried) – approximately 90 calories.  The calorie count would be slightly higher if oil was used in frying.

2. **Chicken Breast (Sliced):**  Assuming approximately 4 oz (113g) of cooked chicken breast – approximately 140-160 calories.  The calorie count will increase slightly if it has been seasoned or cooked with oil.

3. **Feta Cheese:**  Approximately 1 oz (28g) of feta cheese – approximately 75-85 calories.

4. **Tofu:**  Approximately 3 oz (85g) of firm tofu – approximately 80-90 calories.

5. **Greek Yogurt:**  Approximately 1/2 cup of plain Greek yogurt – approximately 60-70 calories.  This will change if it's not plain and has added sugar or fruit.

6. **Chickpeas:** Approximately 1/2 cup (cooked) of chickpeas – approximately 100-120 calories.

7. **Brown or Green Lentils:** Approximately 1/2 cup (cooked) of lentils – approximately 115-125 calories.

8. **Mixed Greens Salad:** A generous serving of mixed greens provides minimal calories (around 10-20 calories)

9. **White Beans (Cannellini):** Approximately 1/2 cup of cooked cannellini beans – approximately 100-120 calories.


**Total Estimated Calories:** Adding up all estimates, the total calories for this meal are likely in the range of **670-800 calories.**  This is a broad range due to the uncertainties around portion sizes.


**Important Note:**  This is a rough estimation. The actual calorie content could vary significantly depending on portion sizes, specific ingredients used (e.g., type of oil for frying), and cooking methods. For a precise calculation, precise ingredient quantities are necessary.  Consult a nutrition tracking app or nutritionist for a more accurate calculation if needed.
